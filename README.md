# Kinisi Motor Controller
Kinisi motor controller is based on STM32F405 microcontroller controller. The controller can control up to 4 brushed DC motors with encoders. It offers platform obstruction which is means user doesnâ€™t need to control each individual motor form main computer, but rather it can control up to four motors as a whole by sending high level commands like set target speed or distance for a platform.
